**Heuristic Evaluation: Audiobooks HQ** 
The app Audiobooks HQ is designed to allow users to download and purchase a wide variety of literature and have it read to them. This app is especially suitable for older audiences because reading can place a lot of strain on the eyes or be a tiring activity. The app then separates your collection of books based on title, author, and recent purchases. When analyzing the heuristics, I found that this app can improve quite a bit in its aesthetics, error prevention, and visibility. There was a lack of warning to users when confirming purchases, deleting or changing one's own book collection, and when downloads would fail. The bright orange color scheme and unpleasing font can also be refined to create a more calming atmosphere for users. Overall, while this app prevailed in its simple features, it can definitely be enhanced with the inclusion of more nifty details.

**Usability Testing**

The Audiobooks HQ app is designed to provide anyone access to over 500,000 texts that they can purchase and listen to. The user is able to downnload the text on the app and listen to it at varying speeds, playback times, and volumes. This app is especially favorable for groups that have the desire to read but do not have the eye strength, energy, or time to do so. This app hopes to make reading much more accessible, portable, and easy by having users to just listen to the text being read to them.

After analyzing this application with all 10 heuristics, I noted that the overall efficiency, clarity, and aesthetic of the app can be greatly improved. The bright orange theme and fonts used are not very pleasurable to look at and make it less enticing to interact with the app's features. The font even hinders the readability of the app as a whole. In addition, a lot of the symbols used can be very confusing to new users, such as the "moon" symbol, which is meant for having the text be read for a set amount of time (ranging from 10 to 90 minutes). The app also does not have strong enough updates to users, such as if downloads fail or percentages of texts downloaded. The overall lack of clarity can raise a lot of questions for users; however, there is also not a strong help center set up in the settings. There are no video tutorials, FAQs, or a help search engine to assist users as efficiently as possible. These are the main criticisms of the app, which is why I wanted to set up the usability testing tasks around these issues.

This UT would help evaluate a user's initial reactions to these issues and understand the user's perspective, which can then point to actions for improvement. The user in this trial will participate in 3 tasks. The first task will test the app's readability based on its overall aesthetic and fonts. The participant will be asked to search for a specific book and find out its price and related readings based on its genre. The second task aims to test the app's error prevention and match with system and real world. The participant will be asked to download that particular reading and select a 20 minute playback time. Lastly, the third task aims to test the app's help and documentation by having the user go to the settings and change the skip back time and to have the user try to find a help center.
