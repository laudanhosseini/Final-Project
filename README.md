# Speed Reads: Making Online Reading More Accessible for Senior Citizens
## Laudan Hosseini, Digital Humanities 110: Final-Project
### Introduction

Hi everyone! My name is Laudan, and today I am here to share with you all a very exciting project which is called “Speed Reads: Making Online Reading Faster, Easier, and more Accessible for Senior Citizens”. Over the past 10 weeks, I have spent time testing, drafting, and revising a high fidelity prototype that is geared towards creating an online reading platform that is user friendly for senior citizens. Initially, I discovered the app Audiobooks HQ, which is designed to allow users to download and purchase a wide variety of literature and have it read to them. This app is especially suitable for older audiences because reading can place a lot of strain on the eyes or be a tiring activity. The app then separates your collection of books based on title, author, and recent purchases. The Audiobooks HQ app is designed to provide anyone access to over 500,000 texts that they can purchase and listen to. The user is able to downnload the text on the app and listen to it at varying speeds, playback times, and volumes. This app is especially favorable for groups that have the desire to read but do not have the eye strength, energy, or time to do so. This app hopes to make reading much more accessible, portable, and easy by having users to just listen to the text being read to them. Therefore, I wanted this project to focus on enhancing this application to provide more technological spaces for senior citizens, as creating user friendly apps for this group is often overlooked.  

### Clear Design Statement

I think that the main issues with the Audiobooks HQ app related to its aesthetics, organization, and clarity of symbols and signals. As a result, I wanted to revamp this application to create a space that is more efficient at filtering out potential reads and that has a more structured library where you can store and access your downloaded reads as fast as possible. This idea is important to me because reading is a very commonplace activity among senior citizens, yet it can become awfully difficult at times to read the fine print on physical books. Technological platforms also seldom include senior citizens as target groups for accessibility and usability, so I wanted to make this more apparent for the online reading world. 

### Competitor Analysis 

**Heuristic Evaluation: Audiobooks HQ** 

Nielson's Heuristic Evaluations was the first step taken towards the development of a user-friendly prototype, as it allows me to evaluate an already existing application that achieves similar goals and performs similar tasks. This would then help me in drafting my own version of the website/application for the purpose of increasing accessibility for senior citizens.

After analyzing this application with all 10 heuristics, I noted that the overall efficiency, clarity, and aesthetic of the app can be greatly improved. The bright orange theme and fonts used are not very pleasurable to look at and make it less enticing to interact with the app's features. The font even hinders the readability of the app as a whole. In addition, a lot of the symbols used can be very confusing to new users, such as the "moon" symbol, which is meant for having the text be read for a set amount of time (ranging from 10 to 90 minutes). The app also does not have strong enough updates to users, such as if downloads fail or percentages of texts downloaded. The overall lack of clarity can raise a lot of questions for users; however, there is also not a strong help center set up in the settings. There are no video tutorials, FAQs, or a help search engine to assist users as efficiently as possible. These are the main criticisms of the app, which is why I wanted to set up the usability testing tasks around these issues.

**Usability Testing**

The usability testing was the first step taken to getting actual feedback on the Audiobooks HQ app from other users. This UT would help evaluate a user's initial reactions to these issues and understand the user's perspective, which can then point to actions for improvement. The user in this trial will participate in 3 tasks. The first task will test the app's readability based on its overall aesthetic and fonts. The participant will be asked to search for a specific book and find out its price and related readings based on its genre. The second task aims to test the app's error prevention and match with system and real world. The participant will be asked to download that particular reading and select a 20 minute playback time. Lastly, the third task aims to test the app's help and documentation by having the user go to the settings and change the skip back time and to have the user try to find a help center.

Reflecting on the UT session, I found that the participant mainly struggled with finding the search bar, which is probably one of the most important features of this application. The user must be able to have strong filters and clear labels such that the user can find the reading he/she is looking for as fast as possible. Thus, when this issue kept arising, it showed me that this feature needs to be significantly changed to make it more user-friendly. 

### User Research 

The Contextual Inquiry is a methodology in prototype testing that helps the creator better understand target audiences and behavioral tasks for a particular website/application. In this scenario, I interviewed a participant about the Audiobooks HQ application to see what usability issues came up when trying to complete tasks and to understand the users' reading habits. This assignment gave me a lot more insight about how to improve the structual organization of the app, how to enhance the aesthetics, and which features to add to make it more user-friendly.

Throughout the process, I saw that the user really emphasized her need for efficient online programs due to her demanding medical classes and the fact that college is fully remote currently. I found that she would have liked better organization on the homepage of the app, as it was very overwhelming and hard to navigate at first glance. She especially struggled with finding the search bar, as she was not sure what the icons for the Bookstores meant or if they were clickable; this was a main issue that the participant in the UT had as well. This gave me a lot of insight on adding additional tabs for the homepage instead of immediately jumping to the user's library of content, adding more filters for the search bar, and making buttons more clearly labeled on the homepage. 

### UX Storytelling 
UX storytelling helps us better understand the wants and needs of consumers for different websites, programs, or applications. By understanding the goals, motivations, challenges, and overall stories of potential users, we are able to understand their perceptions and enhance usability/accessibility. For this project, I am creating two personas and empathy maps for an online reading platform, such as Audible or Audiobooks HQ. I wanted to build one persona around the aspect of improving the advanced tool bar so that users can efficiently find the exact texts they are looking for as fast as possible. I wanted to build a second persona in order to tackle the structural and organizational issues of reading applications, namely in organizing the users' downloaded texts in a more sensible and interactive way.

The two personas I developed are **Mary Rogers, a curious and intelligent Art History Professor,** and **David Muñoz, a loving dad with a desire for relaxing reads**.

### Wireframe and Graphic Design Element Variation 

These wireframes are my initial graphic designs of what I would want my high-fidelity prototype to look like. To make these, I sketched out the pages of Audiobooks HQ and drew arrows to create my wireflow that would complete the tasks 

**(1) Navigating the Search Bar** and 

**(2) Organization of Content**, given the existing features of the app. 

### Task 1: Navigating the Search Bar

### Task 2: Organization of Content

Using Figma, I transferred this rough sketch into a digitized format and combined both tasks onto a single wireframe (shown in multiple screenshots):

### Low-Fidelity Prototype

The key takeaway from this rough draft prototype was mainly about changing the color scheme, adding more frames, and fixing the "go back" symbols. The bright orange color schemes were too overwhelming from initial impression tests, and there were also not enough frames to fully experience the two desired tasks. While the user expressed that the existing frames were smooth to navigate, this prototype was too simplified to capture the full effect.


### High-Fidelity Prototype 

[Here](https://www.figma.com/file/cd5HgXbY3RD3viLLKMnL7C/Final-High-Fidelity-Prototype?node-id=0%3A1) is the link to the interactive prototype!

With this prototype, I conducted multiple impression tests and took in the comments of each user. For instance, I muted the orange colors in the aesthetics, I changed the plus sign on the homepage, I added more "go back" and "home" buttons on each tab, and made the "add new" button more clear. These changes revised any confusions that users experienced while navigating this app. 

### Evaluation and Revision History 

### Cognitive Walkthrough

**Goal**

The goal for this user's cognitive walkthrough is to complete two main tasks regarding the prototype for the application, Audiobooks HQ. The tasks include (1) navigating the search bar of the app and (2) organizing any downloaded or purchased content. 

**Tasks**

This is the script that I had set up for my user to help guide her through the navigation of the application. 

**Task 1: Navigating the Search Bar**
* click to enter the application 
* click either on "Find Books Now!", "Bookstore", "See All" under the New Noteworthy, or plus sign at the bottom of the homepage
* click on either "Search", one of the letters of the alphabets, or one of the filters listed 
* if clicked on "Search", type in the title of the book desired or the author 
* if clicked on one of the filters, scroll through to find the desired book 

**Task 2: Organizing Downloaded or Purchased Content**
* click to enter the application 
* click either on "My Books", "See All" next to New + Noteworthy, or "See All" next to Made for You
* if clicked on "My Books", select one of the categories 
* once category selected, scroll through options or click "See More" to see more options

**Summary**

As the user completed these tasks, I found that most of my predictions were correct. The user struggled with finding the swipe portion of the "Made for You" and "New + Noteworthy" sections, but they did not seem to be phased by the lack of loading pages that were included in the prototype. I still think that moving forward, I would want to include some sort of progress signals, and I also maybe want to make the swipe feature more clear (either by changing the wording of the button or changing the font color). She also found that the arrow buttons to go back to other pages were faulty and only some were working and only some of the time. This is something I definitely would want to look into and fix for the future. Other than these suggestions, the user stated that she found the tasks very easy to complete and did so faster than predicted.

This is located towards the bottom of the site under the "Cognitive Walkthrough" section.



### Impression Test

The participant did not want to be video or audio recorded, but I walked them through an initial impression test and documented some of her reactions that I found to be most important:
* "I think that I would like an addition of different colors of orange to add more dimension"
* "I really like how you put the pictures of books on the homepage and on those buttons"
* "I would maybe choose a different layout for the last page, I like how you separate the filters into buttons but I would maybe mimick the layout as the page with the buttons for organizing content"
* "This is now definitely easier to see how to search for something than the first time you showed me the application"
* "I like the inclusion of the "Add New" button"
* "I would maybe use a different plus sign on the homepage because it is bulky compared to the rest of the aesthetic"

**Summary:** I found her impression test to be incredibly helpful, as she was also the participant in the contextual inquiry assignment. She definitely noticed a lot of improvements compared to the original app; when she first used the app, she was very confused on how to initially search for books, but she noted how much easier it was to do that with this prototype. I also appreciated her comments on the aesthetics of the app, such as with the slight changes in the orange color scheme and the change in the layout for the search bar page. I will definitely take these into account and refine the prototype further for enhancements. 



### Accessibility Audit

### Pitch Video


### Conclusion: what did you learn throughout the process?
Reflecting on this project as a whole, I feel proud of my accomplishments, as this was the first interaction I have ever had with user experience design. There were surely a lot of learning curves with learning how to use programs like Github and Figma and with learning the basics of UX design as a whole. However, I think that all of my testing (UT, Contextual Inquiry, Cognitive Walkthrough, Impression Test) went much smoother than expected and I found these parts of the process to be incredibly helpful in creating my own prototype. I ended up revising a lot of my interactive prototype, such as by changing the color scheme, changing the “add” symbol on the homepage, adding more details like real books as examples for different search filters, and making sure that the “go back” buttons worked on the prototype. At the end of all of the revisions, I think that I have reached a place where users are able to access their downloaded material much easier, find the search bar and filters for books much easier, and have more freedom in organizing their downloaded content. Hopefully, this project is a call to action on the greater need for user-friendly applications for senior citizen groups in general.
