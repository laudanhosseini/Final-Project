# Audiobooks HQ: Making Reading More Accessible for Senior Citizens
## Laudan Hosseini, Digital Humanities 110: Final-Project
### Introduction
What is the project about? The motivation of the project and possible contribution.
The app Audiobooks HQ is designed to allow users to download and purchase a wide variety of literature and have it read to them. This app is especially suitable for older audiences because reading can place a lot of strain on the eyes or be a tiring activity. The app then separates your collection of books based on title, author, and recent purchases.The Audiobooks HQ app is designed to provide anyone access to over 500,000 texts that they can purchase and listen to. The user is able to downnload the text on the app and listen to it at varying speeds, playback times, and volumes. This app is especially favorable for groups that have the desire to read but do not have the eye strength, energy, or time to do so. This app hopes to make reading much more accessible, portable, and easy by having users to just listen to the text being read to them.

### Competitor Analysis 

**Heuristic Evaluation: Audiobooks HQ** 

Nielson's Heuristic Evaluations was the first step taken towards the development of a user-friendly prototype, as it allows me to evaluate an already existing application that achieves similar goals and performs similar tasks. This would then help me in drafting my own version of the website/application for the purpose of increasing accessibility for senior citizens.

After analyzing this application with all 10 heuristics, I noted that the overall efficiency, clarity, and aesthetic of the app can be greatly improved. The bright orange theme and fonts used are not very pleasurable to look at and make it less enticing to interact with the app's features. The font even hinders the readability of the app as a whole. In addition, a lot of the symbols used can be very confusing to new users, such as the "moon" symbol, which is meant for having the text be read for a set amount of time (ranging from 10 to 90 minutes). The app also does not have strong enough updates to users, such as if downloads fail or percentages of texts downloaded. The overall lack of clarity can raise a lot of questions for users; however, there is also not a strong help center set up in the settings. There are no video tutorials, FAQs, or a help search engine to assist users as efficiently as possible. These are the main criticisms of the app, which is why I wanted to set up the usability testing tasks around these issues.

**Usability Testing**

The usability testing was the first step taken to getting actual feedback on the Audiobooks HQ app from other users. This UT would help evaluate a user's initial reactions to these issues and understand the user's perspective, which can then point to actions for improvement. The user in this trial will participate in 3 tasks. The first task will test the app's readability based on its overall aesthetic and fonts. The participant will be asked to search for a specific book and find out its price and related readings based on its genre. The second task aims to test the app's error prevention and match with system and real world. The participant will be asked to download that particular reading and select a 20 minute playback time. Lastly, the third task aims to test the app's help and documentation by having the user go to the settings and change the skip back time and to have the user try to find a help center.

Reflecting on the UT session, I found that the participant mainly struggled with finding the search bar, which is probably one of the most important features of this application. The user must be able to have strong filters and clear labels such that the user can find the reading he/she is looking for as fast as possible. Thus, when this issue kept arising, it showed me that this feature needs to be significantly changed to make it more user-friendly. 

### User Research (Contextual Inquiry and Assignment #3)

The Contextual Inquiry is a methodology in prototype testing that helps the creator better understand target audiences and behavioral tasks for a particular website/application. In this scenario, I interviewed a participant about the Audiobooks HQ application to see what usability issues came up when trying to complete tasks and to understand the users' reading habits. This assignment gave me a lot more insight about how to improve the structual organization of the app, how to enhance the aesthetics, and which features to add to make it more user-friendly.

Throughout the process, I saw that the user really emphasized her need for efficient online programs due to her demanding medical classes and the fact that college is fully remote currently. I found that she would have liked better organization on the homepage of the app, as it was very overwhelming and hard to navigate at first glance. She especially struggled with finding the search bar, as she was not sure what the icons for the Bookstores meant or if they were clickable; this was a main issue that the participant in the UT had as well. This gave me a lot of insight on adding additional tabs for the homepage instead of immediately jumping to the user's library of content, adding more filters for the search bar, and making buttons more clearly labeled on the hompage.
